# Skills

A collection of agent skills for SEO analysis, topical authority planning, marketing conversion review, X/social post drafting, frontend/UI guidance, and WordPress.org plugin search ranking work.

Each skill lives in its own directory and is defined by a `SKILL.md` file with frontmatter metadata (`name`, `description`, and optional compatibility/licensing notes) followed by the workflow instructions an agent should follow.
